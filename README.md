# Toy-VFS
A Linux Toy File System involving the Linux Kernel Operating System.


## Overview
1. :white_check_mark: A kernel module interfaces with the VFS or Linux and redirects all calls to your toy file system which must be implemented in User space.
2. Your toy file system implements a simple, flat file system that can create files and keep its attributes in a root directory.
3. :white_check_mark: Your file system can be mounted like any other file system in Linux.
4. You must be able to read/write to your files. And files must reflect such operations.
5. You must maintain basic metadata for your files.
6. A linux kernel module that captures file system requests addressed to your file system and forwards them to user-space program.
7. A communication mechanism to pass data from kernel to user and viceversa (i.e. proc file system, device under dev/ directory, netlink sockets--your choice of mechanism)
8. :white_check_mark: A process in user-space that stores your file and process all file system requests forwarded by the kernel module.

##Compiling Instructions
1.  $ make                                       [Run from local file]
2.  $ sudo insmod toyfs_mod.ko                   [Insert Module]   
3.  $ dmesg | tail -5                            [Check for printk commands 'Successful']
4.  $ cat /proc/filesystems | grep toyfs         [Check if 'toyfs' is registered        ]
5.  $ touch image                                [Create an empty 'Disk Image']
6.  $ mkdir dir                                  [Create the Mount Folder in Directory]        
7.  $ sudo mount -o loop -t toyfs ./image ./dir  [Assemble File System]
8.  $ dmesg | tail -10                           [Change tail as necessary]
9.  $ modinfo toyfs_mod.ko                       [View module information]
10. $ sudo umount ./dir                          [Unmount File System]
11. $ sudo rmmod toyfs_mod                       [Remove Module]
12. $ dmesg                                      [Check if Unregistered and Unounted]
